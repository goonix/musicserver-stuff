# Home music server

Around 2008 I started purchasing most of my music through Bandcamp and it broadened my musical taste and opened me up to a whole world of independent artists I might not have found otherwise. I spare you any stats but you can peruse here: https://bandcamp.com/groovypenguin
If you're inclined, support an independent artist today! I've met so many great folks that influenced my own musicianship and listening tendencies who just love music.

Because of this pasttime, I've had a music server in one fashion or another over the years and my current instance is backed by Navidrome. This repository is a collection of configuration backups, scripts, etc.
